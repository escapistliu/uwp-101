# Concurrency in Go Language üöÄ

This repository provides an in-depth guide to understanding concurrency in the Go programming language. It covers core concepts, detailed features, and practical examples, making it a valuable resource for developers‚Äîespecially computer science students‚Äîlooking to master Go's concurrency model for efficient, scalable applications.

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è
1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Initialize a Go Module: Set up a new project with:
```
go mod init concurrency-example
```
3. Imports: Use standard libraries like "sync", "time", or "context" as needed in your code.
   
## Concepts üîó
Concurrency in Go is built around the following fundamental ideas:

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime for concurrent execution.
- **Channels**: Typed communication pipes that synchronize and pass data between goroutines.
- **Select Statement**: A mechanism to handle multiple channel operations at once.
- **Synchronization Primitives**: Tools like mutexes and wait groups to manage shared resources.
These concepts are orchestrated by the Go runtime, which handles scheduling and execution behind the scenes.

## Features üìö
### Goroutines
- **Lightweight**: Created and managed by the Go runtime, not the OS, with low overhead.
- **Dynamic Stack**: Starts with a small stack (e.g., 2 KB) that grows as needed.
- **Syntax**: Use the go keyword to launch a function concurrently.

### Channels
- **Typed**: Channels specify the data type they carry (e.g., chan int).
- **Blocking**: Send and receive operations synchronize goroutines naturally.
- **Safe**: Prevents race conditions by avoiding shared memory access.

### Select Statement
- **Multiplexing**: Waits on multiple channel operations, executing the first ready one.
- **Default Case**: Optional non-blocking behavior with a default clause.
- **Timeouts**: Pair with time.After for time-limited waits.

### Synchronization Primitives
- **Mutexes**: sync.Mutex locks shared resources to prevent concurrent modification.
- **WaitGroups**: sync.WaitGroup ensures all goroutines complete before proceeding.

### Go Runtime
- **Scheduler**: Maps goroutines to OS threads efficiently.
- **GOMAXPROCS**: Configures the number of OS threads for parallelism (set via runtime.GOMAXPROCS).

## Examples üìù
Here are practical, runnable code snippets showcasing Go‚Äôs concurrency features.

### Basic Goroutine üì¨
Run a concurrent task with sync.WaitGroup for proper synchronization:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello()
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for goroutine
}
```

Output: 
```
Hello from goroutine!
```

### Channel Communication üì¨
Pass data between goroutines and close the channel when done:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func producer(ch chan<- int) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    go producer(ch)
    for val := range ch {
        fmt.Println("Received:", val)
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Received: 0
Received: 1
Received: 2
Received: 3
Received: 4
```

Note: Closing the channel lets range know when to stop.

### Select Multiplexing üì¨
Handle multiple channels with a timeout:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ch1 := make(chan string)
    ch2 := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        ch1 <- "Message from ch1"
    }()

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        ch2 <- "Message from ch2"
    }()

    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-ch1:
            fmt.Println(msg1)
        case msg2 := <-ch2:
            fmt.Println(msg2)
        case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("Timeout")
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Message from ch2
Message from ch1
```

Note: Goroutine scheduling is non-deterministic, so output order isn‚Äôt guaranteed.

### Mutex Synchronization üì¨
Protect a shared counter with a mutex:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var counter int
var mutex sync.Mutex

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    mutex.Lock()
    counter++
    mutex.Unlock()
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go increment(&wg)
    }
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Final counter:", counter)
}
```

Output: 
```
Final counter: 1000
```

### Atomic Synchronization üì¨
Use sync/atomic for lock-free increments:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "sync/atomic"
)

var counter int32

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    atomic.AddInt32(&counter, 1)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go increment(&wg)
    }
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Final counter:", counter)
}
```

Output: 
```
Final counter: 1000
```
### Context for Cancellation üì¨
Cancel a goroutine with context.Context:

```
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func longTask(ctx context.Context) {
    select {
    case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Task completed! üéâ")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Task canceled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 1*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    go longTask(ctx)
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Wait to observe cancellation
}
```

Output: 
```
Task canceled: context deadline exceeded
```

## Best Practices üí°
- **Use Channels**: Prefer channels over shared memory for communication.
- **Keep It Simple**: Leverage goroutines and channels for clean, modular code.
- **Limit Mutexes**: Use sync.Mutex only when necessary to avoid complexity.
- **Avoid Leaks**: Ensure goroutines terminate (e.g., close channels or use context).

## Real-World Use Cases üåç
### Web Servers üåê
Handle HTTP requests concurrently:
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, concurrent world! üåç")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    fmt.Println("Server starting on :8080... üöÄ")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
Note: Each request runs in its own goroutine, managed by net/http.

Output: 
```
Task canceled: context deadline exceeded
```

### Pipelines üåê
Process data in stages with channels:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func gen(nums ...int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for _, n := range nums {
            out <- n
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}

func square(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for n := range in {
            out <- n * n
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}

func main() {
    in := gen(2, 3, 4)
    out := square(in)
    for n := range out {
        fmt.Println(n) // 4, 9, 16
    }
}
```

Output: 
```
4
9
16
```
