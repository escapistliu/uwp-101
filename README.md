# Concurrency in Go Language üöÄ

Concurrency is at the heart of what makes Go (Golang) such a compelling language for modern software development. This repository delves into the nuances of Go‚Äôs concurrency model‚Äîencompassing goroutines, channels, and the select statement‚Äîto help you build highly performant, scalable applications. By exploring core concepts, features, and practical examples, this guide serves as an invaluable resource for developers and computer science students looking to take advantage of Go‚Äôs elegant approach to concurrent programming. Beyond the concurrency model itself, Go‚Äôs simplicity, strong standard library, and efficient runtime make it a top choice for projects ranging from microservices to large-scale systems.
   
## Concepts üîó
Concurrency in Go is built around the following fundamental ideas:

- ***Goroutines***: Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime for concurrent execution.
- ***Channels***: Typed communication pipes that synchronize and pass data between goroutines.
- ***Select Statement***: A mechanism to handle multiple channel operations at once.
- ***Synchronization Primitives***: Tools like mutexes and wait groups to manage shared resources.
These concepts are orchestrated by the Go runtime, which handles scheduling and execution behind the scenes.

## Features üìö
### Goroutines
- ***Lightweight***: Created and managed by the Go runtime, not the OS, with low overhead.
- ***Dynamic Stack***: Starts with a small stack (e.g., 2 KB) that grows as needed.
- ***Syntax***: Use the go keyword to launch a function concurrently.

### Channels
- ***Typed***: Channels specify the data type they carry (e.g., chan int).
- ***Blocking***: Send and receive operations synchronize goroutines naturally.
- ***Safe***: Prevents race conditions by avoiding shared memory access.

### Select Statement
- ***Multiplexing***: Waits on multiple channel operations, executing the first ready one.
- ***Default Case***: Optional non-blocking behavior with a default clause.
- ***Timeouts***: Pair with time.After for time-limited waits.

### Synchronization Primitives
- ***Mutexes***: sync.Mutex locks shared resources to prevent concurrent modification.
- ***WaitGroups***: sync.WaitGroup ensures all goroutines complete before proceeding.

### Go Runtime
- ***Scheduler***: Maps goroutines to OS threads efficiently.
- ***GOMAXPROCS***: Configures the number of OS threads for parallelism (set via runtime.GOMAXPROCS).

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è
1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Initialize a Go Module: Set up a new project with:
```
go mod init concurrency-example
```
3. Imports: Use standard libraries like "sync", "time", or "context" as needed in your code.
   
## Examples üìù
Here are practical, runnable code snippets showcasing Go‚Äôs concurrency features.

### Basic Goroutine üì¨
Run a concurrent task with sync.WaitGroup for proper synchronization:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello()
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for goroutine
}
```

Output: 
```
Hello from goroutine!
```

### Channel Communication üì¨
Pass data between goroutines and close the channel when done:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func producer(ch chan<- int) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    go producer(ch)
    for val := range ch {
        fmt.Println("Received:", val)
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Received: 0
Received: 1
Received: 2
Received: 3
Received: 4
```

Note: Closing the channel lets range know when to stop.

### Select Multiplexing üì¨
Handle multiple channels with a timeout:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ch1 := make(chan string)
    ch2 := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        ch1 <- "Message from ch1"
    }()

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        ch2 <- "Message from ch2"
    }()

    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-ch1:
            fmt.Println(msg1)
        case msg2 := <-ch2:
            fmt.Println(msg2)
        case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("Timeout")
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Message from ch2
Message from ch1
```

Note: Goroutine scheduling is non-deterministic, so output order isn‚Äôt guaranteed.

### Mutex Synchronization üì¨
Protect a shared counter with a mutex:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var counter int
var mutex sync.Mutex

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    mutex.Lock()
    counter++
    mutex.Unlock()
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go increment(&wg)
    }
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Final counter:", counter)
}
```

Output: 
```
Final counter: 1000
```

### Atomic Synchronization üì¨
Use sync/atomic for lock-free increments:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "sync/atomic"
)

var counter int32

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    atomic.AddInt32(&counter, 1)
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go increment(&wg)
    }
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Final counter:", counter)
}
```

Output: 
```
Final counter: 1000
```
### Context for Cancellation üì¨
Cancel a goroutine with context.Context:

```
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func longTask(ctx context.Context) {
    select {
    case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Task completed! üéâ")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Task canceled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 1*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    go longTask(ctx)
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Wait to observe cancellation
}
```

Output: 
```
Task canceled: context deadline exceeded
```

## Best Practices üí°
- ***Use Channels***: Prefer channels over shared memory for communication.
- ***Keep It Simple***: Leverage goroutines and channels for clean, modular code.
- ***Limit Mutexes***: Use sync.Mutex only when necessary to avoid complexity.
- ***Avoid Leaks***: Ensure goroutines terminate (e.g., close channels or use context).

## Real-World Use Cases üåç
### Web Servers üåê
Handle HTTP requests concurrently:
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, concurrent world! üåç")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    fmt.Println("Server starting on :8080... üöÄ")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
Note: Each request runs in its own goroutine, managed by net/http.

Output: 
```
Task canceled: context deadline exceeded
```

### Pipelines üåê
Process data in stages with channels:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func gen(nums ...int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for _, n := range nums {
            out <- n
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}

func square(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for n := range in {
            out <- n * n
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}

func main() {
    in := gen(2, 3, 4)
    out := square(in)
    for n := range out {
        fmt.Println(n) // 4, 9, 16
    }
}
```

Output: 
```
4
9
16
```
